## Mint Guidance

Piday Metaverse maps align with real-world geography, requiring users to compare Piday's maps with external mapping tools (e.g., Google Maps) to identify their desired locations.

### Steps to Mint a Land Parcel:

1. **Navigate to Continent and Country**  
   Start by identifying the desired continent and then narrow down to the target country. For example:
   - Locate Europe and zoom into France.

2. **Refine Search to City and Region**  
   Zoom into the specific city, e.g., Paris, and continue narrowing to neighborhoods or landmarks.

3. **Pinpoint the Exact Location**  
   - Locate the landmark or area of interest using external maps for reference. For example, use Google Maps to identify the Eiffel Tower's location.
   - Cross-check the location on the Piday map to ensure accuracy.

4. **Select a Hexagonal Parcel**  
   - Once the map displays a honeycomb-like layer, choose a hexagonal plot of land.
   - **Purple Hexagons**: Indicate already-minted parcels. Select an adjacent hexagon.

5. **Complete the Minting Process**  
   - Double-click on your selected land parcel. The map zooms into the land's detail page.
   - Click the **"MINT" button** and complete the payment process.

## Selection Strategy

When minting near a landmark that spans multiple hexagons, consider the following strategies:

1. **Film Strategy**  
   Mint all hexagons occupied by the landmark. Future use cases may include:
   - Uploading images, videos, or 3D scenes.
   - Renting lands or charging for AR experiences.

2. **Single-Piece Strategy**  
   Mint the central hexagon of the landmark. Surrounding lands may increase in value as users aim to complete the set.

3. **Frontal Strategy**  
   Mint the hexagon facing the landmark's primary view. This ensures prominent visibility for AR tourism or uploaded content.

4. **Encirclement Strategy**  
   Mint hexagons surrounding a sold-out landmark. Anticipate value appreciation or acquisition from adjacent landowners.

5. **Linear Strategy**  
   Mint a row of hexagons along one side of a landmark. Straight-line plots are attractive for future expansions or AR displays.
